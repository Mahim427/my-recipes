    <h1>Lemon Poke Cake</h1>
    <p>This lemon poke cake is super moist. It is called a poke cake because you poke holes in it to absorb the glaze. If you want, you can serve this tangy cake with whipped topping or vanilla ice cream.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (15.25) package yellow cake mix</li>
        <li>1 (3.4 ounce) package instant lemon pudding mix</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>⅓ cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            To make the cake: Stir cake mix and instant pudding together in a large bowl. Add water, oil, and eggs; mix until smooth and well blended. Spread batter evenly into the prepared pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted comes out clean, about 40 to 45 minutes. While cake is still hot, poke holes in the top with a fork.
        </li>
        <li>
            To make the sweet lemon glaze: Mix lemon juice and confectioners sugar together in a small bowl until smooth; pour over hot cake and allow to seep into the holes. Let cake cool completely before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
